# Repetition Syntax

'''
* : a patter followed by "*"  is repeated zero or more times
+ : a pattern followed by "+" is repeated 1 or more times
? : a patter followed by  "?" is repeated o or 1 times
{m}: For a specific number of occurrences, use {m} after the pattern,
      where m is replaced with the number of times the pattern should repeat.
{m,n}: Use {m,n} where m is the minimum number of repetitions and n is the maximum.
     Leaving out n {m,} means the value appears at least m times, with no maximum
